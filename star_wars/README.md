# Star Wars Miniature

Playable version at http://ondras.github.com/star-wars!

## About

This is a submission to the [GitHub Game Off 2012 contest](https://github.com/blog/1303-github-game-off).

You play as a young jedi/sith warrior, making your way through enemies in order to finish your force training. Fortunately, your trusty lightsaber is available, as well as some more force-related goodies.

## Features

* Starwars-based roguelike
* Built using rot.js
* Lightsaber, Force **push**, Force **pull**, Force **fork** (lightning)
* Enemies: **clone** army, jedis/siths, battle droids, Mickey Mouse
* Infinite, procedurally generated terrain
* Sounds (not mine)

## License

	Sound files: shamelessly copied from Star Wars video games and freesound.org.
	Should any legal/IP-related issues arise, let me know: I will happily remove 
	all sounds to rectify the situation.
